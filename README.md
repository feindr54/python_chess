# python_chess (WIP)
CX's attempt into programming chess in python. 

## Current status
- The internal board structure, alphabetic and numeric notation are working pretty well. 
- Most of the piece movements are completed (except for king)
- Console inplementation seems fine

## Remaining goals 
- Work on an actual GUI 
- Finalise on movement of the King (decide how to deal with "threatened squares", castling)
